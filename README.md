# Headers predictor

### Pre-requirements
Jupyter with python 3 environment
### Usage
Inside the project's directory run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then open `headers_predictor.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter, run it cell by cell and read markdowns for understanding the solution.

For production, using ordinary codebase (with .py files) is reasonable. Here .ipynb was used for better presentation and explanation of model's work.
